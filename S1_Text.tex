\section*{S1 Text: UK's economic sectors dependent on international links}



Based on \emph {AMADEUS} dataset, the most vulnerable economic sectors in the United Kingdom have been highlighted. The later are the ones due to be mostly affected by eventual future lock-downs of the international economy (international ownership links). 

When considering the UK sectors generating the highest turnover in 2018 mostly dependent on foreign capital they own (out-going links from the UK) these are extraction of crude petroleum, manufacture of tobacco products and of basic pharmaceutical goods. In terms of in-going links to the UK, activities of head offices and holding companies, sale of cars and manufacture of motor vehicles are sectors mostly dependent on foreign ownership coming from abroad.
